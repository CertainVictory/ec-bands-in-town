Hello EcoCart!

I'll be reusing some of the boilerplate from the react readme for this. This project was a lot of fun!

I tried to everything in vanilla ReactJS. There probably could have been more elegant solutions to this using a library. 
Ideally I would've loved to have added `styled-components` for cleaner a `.css` solution!
